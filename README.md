# Budgetting Website

This is my first time programming with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so in order to learn, I decided to build a simple budgetting website to help users track their finances and to aid them in allocating their money in a better manner.

Features I hope to add are:
1. A pie chart detailing where the user spends their income.
2. Recommendations for users to help users budget.

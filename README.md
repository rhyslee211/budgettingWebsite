# Budgetting Website

This is my first time programming with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so in order to learn, I decided to build a simple budgetting website to help users track their finances and to aid them in allocating their money in a better manner.

Features I hope to add are:

1. A doughnut chart detailing where the user spends their income. - âœ…
2. Financial recommendations for where users can put their leftover money, or where to cut if overspending.
3. Allow users to set goals and help them plan financially to reach them.
